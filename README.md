# zombie splatter!

A simple top-down shooter being developed in pygame.

HUGE thanks to Mikael LÃ¶vqvist for debugging, streamlining, and in general being a genius with python

WASD/Mouse OR!!! Gamepad.

Note, if you have a gamepad connected, keyboard controls may not work.

To launch the game, clone the repo and run gameCore.py

Have fun, splatter some zombies, hack on the source, make new maps, whatever you want.

map_editor.py will launch the map editor.
the map editor modifies maps.db (sqlite3) which contains both the map tile data and the nodeGraph for the a* pathfinding algorithm.


Controls in the map editor are:
WASD to change map
mousewheel to change tile type (stone, grass, etc)
mouse to place
mouse2 to void tile (literally leaves a black void)
mouse3 (middle-click) to commit the map and nodegraph to database

If you are replacing existing tiles, you should void them before placing new.
